# ESP-GPS-Logger
GPS logger for Speedsurfing, based on ESP32 &amp; Ublox M8N hardware.
GPS_logger for speedsurfing This is a project for a gps-speedlogger with a ESP32 Âµ-controller. The hardware is a e-paper display with build in ESP32 and micro SD-card(lilygo ttgo T5). A gps (ublox compatible)is connected over serial. GPS is configured for sending ubx navpvt messages. Freq can be 1,2,4 or 10 Hz. Every message is logged to the sd-card. For speedsurfing, next values are measured and visible on the e-paper : Max speed 2s, 10s, 5*10s average, speed over 100m, 200m, 500m, 1852 m, max 30 min / 60 min, total distance. SW is written in Arduino IDE. For easy access to the files on the sd, a ftp-server over wifi is integrated. Also OTA (over the air update) of the sw is possible.
